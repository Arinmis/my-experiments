# File-Based-Approach-to-Data
This challenge suggested to me by my professor to understand how file based approach is hard to keep data in it.

## Challenge Tasks:
Change those informatin inside the "Inventory.csv":
1. Change the price of an item, for example increase the price of Snickers to 2.25
2. Change the quantity of an item, for example, a customer purchases 2 Coca Colas so we should reduce the number in quantity
3. Add an item, for example we need to add an item for "Dogadan Yesil Cay" with the type being "Coffee and Tea".
